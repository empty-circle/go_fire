# go_fire
This is an experiment using GPT-4 to generate a blackbox AI and train it on the game of Go.
In this particular repository and for this particular experiment I am acting as an 'ai whisperer' or 'ai shepherd' and guiding GPT-4 to develop a program. The experment is to see how best to utilize this tool for complicated procedures and coding that is far beyond my own personal capability at this point (as of this writing, scrappy_pup is about the limit of my python skill). This is more of a side-project than anything related to my cybersecurity repos.

Note: You'll need to supply your own training data.
